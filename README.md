# Rocket Launcher Simulator 3D

## ❔About
In this simulator, you are able to launch rockets into the sky! Try different launch angles with random wind force directions to reach places on the map.

The rocket also contains a lot of information to track coordinates and four launch states (launch, main engine stage, secondary engine stage, and parachute) that can change the results, how higher and far will you get?

## 🧠 My experience
There was new things that I have learned and most of them was related to the Rigibody component from Unity.

It gave me more knowledge about how gravity works, about the types of joint that can simulate a lot of movement types and some useful urndestanding about methods like OnJointBreak(float breakForce).
